h1. mirror.4.elexis

This is just a simple maven/tycho build script to create a P2 mirror which should contain
all needed features and plugins to create an Elexis 3.0 application.

In a seperate project https://github.com/elexis/elexis.3rdparty.libraries we transformed
some maven artefacts into p2 plugins

This is a new attempt to offer also all stuff from the delta packs for all of our supported architectures.
